You should only need the plugin to get started.

The project just holds the test map which can be found in the plugin content.

Quick Start:

  Create a new data table that uses FMIDWrapper as it's struct.
  Fill out the table values to match your material parameters.
  Add an MIDManagerComponent to your actor.
  Set the default table row value.
  and call SetDefaultMID in the actors constructor.
